  <h1>About FootieSim</h1>

  <p><strong>FootieSim</strong> is a football simulation project built for players who love the tactical and analytical side of the game. Our goal is to make football simulation realistic, fast, and customizable — so you can manage matches your way.</p>

  <h2>⚽ Match Calculator</h2>
  <p>The Match Calculator is the heart of FootieSim. It lets you simulate any football match instantly. Every goal, chance, and scoreline is based on real performance logic — not random luck. You can even tweak team strengths, home advantage, and moral effects to get the most realistic result possible.</p>

  <h2>📊 Rating Calculator</h2>
  <p>The Rating Calculator helps you calculate player ratings based on their performance and stats. You can adjust attributes like pace, dribbling, passing, and defense to see how each factor impacts the team’s overall power. It’s perfect for comparing teams, players, or creating custom lineups.</p>

  <h2>🎯 Presets</h2>
  <p>Don’t want to enter everything manually? Our Presets feature lets you use ready-made setups. You can choose from balanced, attacking, or defensive styles — or create your own preset for your dream lineup.</p>

  <h2>⚙️ Advanced Settings</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Home Advantage:</strong> Give the home team a performance boost to make simulations more realistic.</li>
    <li><strong>Detailed Analysis:</strong> Get a full breakdown of your match — not just the score. See who dominated possession, who played better, and where the match turned.</li>
    <li><strong>Manual 11:</strong> Write your own player ratings for each position. Full control over your lineup.</li>
    <li><strong>Moral System:</strong> Players perform differently depending on morale — confidence and team spirit matter here.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🚀 Why FootieSim?</h2>
  <p>We built FootieSim to make football simulation smarter, faster, and fairer. Whether you’re testing tactics, managing dream teams, or just seeing who’d win in a fantasy matchup — FootieSim gives you the tools to make it happen.</p>
